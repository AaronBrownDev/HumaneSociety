- User authentication system

### Internal Management System
- Animal tracking with medical history management
- Adoption workflow processing
- Volunteer scheduling and management
- Inventory tracking for supplies and donations
- Reporting dashboard for operational insights
- Role-based access control system
- Audit logging for accountability

## Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Go (Golang)
- **Database**: Microsoft SQL Server
- **API**: RESTful architecture
- **Frontend**: React.js with modern UI components
- **Deployment**: Docker containerization
- **Authentication**: JWT with refresh token rotation
