               We couldnâ€™t do it without our compassionate, dedicated, long-term volunteers. Each year our volunteers give hands-on care to animals, 
               educate our community, provide administrative support, and more. HSNWLA volunteers report a deep sense of satisfaction in contributing to 
               the health and well-being of animals while working alongside others who desire to take action on their behalf.</h3>
